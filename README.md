# üõ†Ô∏è A work in progress!


THE PLAN:
1. Disappear cursor until escape
1. Make a hook that mananges certain thingies
2. For now, use the hook to indicate that a box is clicked
3. When a box is clicked, update the attribute in the hook
4. This moves the camera forward in the MousePeekEffect componenet (maybe?)? Or just moves it forward relative to where the user currently is
5. At the same time, the box expands in width slowly, dissolving when it's out of the player's POV
