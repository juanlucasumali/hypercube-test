# üõ†Ô∏è A work in progress!


THE PLAN:
1. Change cursor to be a pixelated one
2. Create a Zoom pixelated into the universe maybe ripple effect when going into the box
3. Make mobile friendly; box toggle and title are fixed to the screen

1. Make a hook that mananges certain thingies
2. For now, use the hook to indicate that a box is clicked
3. When a box is clicked, update the attribute in the hook
4. This moves the camera forward in the MousePeekEffect componenet (maybe?)? Or just moves it forward relative to where the user currently is
5. At the same time, the box expands in width slowly, dissolving when it's out of the player's POV
